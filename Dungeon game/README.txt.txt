This is simple game written in C#.

Controls are WASD (planning to add option to choose wasd or arrows controlls).

The player "P" can collect coins "C" and find the exit "E".

For now the game ends if the player hits a wall. //Walks off the map(char[,]).

Maps are generated randomly and they are always a square.

Player starts on 0;0.

Added levels (Collection of maps chained similar to the levels in binding of isaac).

Future plans:
-Add enemies in some form.
-Add items and health.
-Add shop where you can spend coins.
-Add boss rooms(bigger maps) with bosses.
